### Raw RNA-Seq data
paired_end: True
read_length: 75
fastq_dir: input/fastq
fastq_map: input/fastq_map.txt
## If paired_end is False, kallisto requires estimated fragment (NOT read) length and standard deviation:
# fragment_length_mean: 200
# fragment_length_sd: 50

### Reference files
## Download and unzip genome, e.g. http://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-106/fasta/homo_sapiens/dna/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.primary_assembly.fa.gz
ref_genome: input/ref/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.primary_assembly.chr1_0-2Mb.fa
## Download and unzip gene annotations, e.g. http://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-106/gtf/homo_sapiens/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.106.gtf.gz
ref_anno: input/ref/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.106.chr1_0-2Mb.gtf

### Samples to include (any samples in the FASTQ map but not listed here will be ignored):
samples_file: input/samples.txt

### RNA editing
## Edit sites reference file (make sure chromosome names are consistent with the reference genome)
edit_sites_bed: input/ref/All.AG.stranded.annovar.Hg38_multianno.AnnoAlu.AnnoRep.NR.chr1_0-2Mb.nochr.bed
## Minimum coverage and samples required for a given site to be included. If there are fewer samples than this, the min_samples threshold is lowered to the number of samples.
edit_sites_min_coverage: 20
edit_sites_min_samples: 60

### Optional parameters
## Path to intermediate file directory, in case you don't want it inside this project directory due to its size:
## This directory will be created if it doesn't exist, and will contain any generated (i.e. not input) files besides the final phenotype outputs.
# intermediate_dir: intermediate
## Path to directory where intermediate reference files will be created:
## This will be in the intermediate dir by default, but can be specified to be outside the project dir.
## This could be useful if running multiple datasets with the same parameters, allowing the intermediate
## reference files to be generated once and shared by all the dataset runs.
# intermediate_ref_dir: intermediate/reference

### Modality groups
## List the modality groups to extract, with list of expected output files for each.
## A snakefile will be loaded for each group, steps/{groupname}.smk
## Each group represents one or more modalities that are generated from the same
## software.
